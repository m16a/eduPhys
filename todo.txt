Box-box collision detection

Compare result with another phys engine
	* impulse applying was compared with ODE
	* rotation quaternion integration was fixed and compared with ODE

Add external torque
Unit tests would be fine
Textures
Contact solver

Make smooth key scene rotation

Review old camera code
Clear timeline
Clear animation

Profile low FPS on collision
	* gprof analys was made
	* provide AABB for boxes
