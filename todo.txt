Box-box overlap
Box-box collision detection
Contact solver
Provide stop condition for bouncing near rest position
Review old camera code
Linux rendering bug, scene disappearing
Clear timeline
Clear animation
Add external torque
Slow time issue
Big timestep contact issue (looks like step is too big. On collision if sphere center is in box - collision point is sphere center )
Unit tests would be fine
